**IMPORTANT:** The [various Gitomator projects](https://github.com/gitomator) have been re-organized:

 * [`gitomator`](https://github.com/gitomator/gitomator) contains most of the general-purpose functionality, including command-line tools.
 * [`gitomator-classroom`](https://github.com/gitomator/gitomator-classroom) contains more "experimental" code that shows how Gitomator can be used to implement more complex workflow.
